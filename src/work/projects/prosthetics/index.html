<h1>Low Cost Prothesis in Mexico</h1>

<p>Thistle Prosthetics is a pitch for a social enterprise, leveraging new manufacturing technologies to develop highly effective but affordable prosthetics in Mexico. </p>

<p> The idea is based off of a project I worked on while as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Mexico, from 2012 to 2014. Leveraging my background in robotics, and with the help of my host-father, who has been running an NGO to provide support for local Mexicans with disabilities, we built a small workshop to manufacture low-cost 3D printed prostheses. </p>


<p>   While our initial pilot was successful, this project never took off for lack of capital, and lack of entrepreneurial talent at the time. If the problem and opportunity still exist in the future, I would very much like to scale this project up as a real social enterprise</p>

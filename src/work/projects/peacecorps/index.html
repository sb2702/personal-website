<h1>Peace Corps Mexico</h1>

<p>In 2012, I left my PhD program at Vanderbilt to join the Peace Corps, which sent me to Puebla, Mexico, where I worked on 3 projects related to technology, education and outreach.</p>



<h2>Engineering outreach camp</h2>

<p>During the summer of 2013, and in collaboration with both <a href="http://inaoep.mx/"  style="color: #002EBE;"> ELiTE Education</a> and <a href="http://inaoep.mx/"  style="color: #002EBE;"> INAOE</a> I organized a month-long summer engineering camp for 30 students from around Puebla, Mexico - with courses on Astrophysics, Chemistry, Mechatronics and Programming.</p>,

<h2>Low-cost prosthesis</h2>

<p>While living and working in <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciudad_Serd%C3%A1n" style="color: #002EBE">Ciudad Serd√°n</a>, I began a project with my host father, Don Bernardo Vazquez, to build low-cost prostheses using new manufacturing technques, including 3d printing. We built a workshop, and in our pilot we build serveral successful prostheses for members of the local community, before putting the project on hold for lack of funds. </p>

<h2>Computational Thinking</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking" style="color: #002EBE"> Computational Thinking </a> is a way of teaching the fundamentals of computer science, without actually programming.


    <p>A new subject even in the US, I worked with 3 professors at my partner instutition, <a href="http://inaoep.mx/"  style="color: #002EBE;"> INAOE</a>, to "bring Computational Thinking to Mexico." This involved developing a spanish-language curriculum, writing a textbook on the subject, and developing teacher-training workshops.</p>

    <p> This project was the first major attempt to introduce the topic into schools in Latin America, and it culminated in <a href="http://www.pensamientocomputacional.org/" style="color: #002EBE"> Pensamiento Computacional</a> a free online website with all the materials we developed </p>

    dot Learn's proprietary technology converts videos to a vector-based format, reducing video size by 10x-100x while increasing video quality for many kinds of videos - particularly animations and video-learning.

    Through our SaaS platform/APIs, companies can convert videos to our data-light format, enabling fast and affordable access even on slow/expensive internet connections in emerging markets.
